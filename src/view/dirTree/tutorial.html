							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>
								Hello. Yes this is AntGame.
							</p>
							<p>
								AntGame is a challenge of cunnning and logic. Consider a world with a finite food supply scattered throughout. It is your task, as the player, to collect as much food as possible. In order to succeed in this goal, you wield an army of ants, whom you must carefully instruct in the ways of their world. Without you, they are nothing. 
							</p>
							<p>
								At the same time, another player has their own army of ants, who are trying to gather up the same limited food supply. The player with the most food at the end wins the game. Have you got what it takes to give your ants the competetive edge? 
							</p>

							<h2>How to Play</h2>
							<p>
								When you load the game, you are greeted with the following screen: (you've probably already seen this)
							</p>
							<center><img src="./img/startscreen.png"></center>
							<p>
								Keep an eye on that white bar at the bottom. That's the breadcrumb trail. It tells you where you are and where you've been. You can use it to travel back up in the menu structure. Using your browser's back button will take you away from AntGame and we don't want that to happen so remember to use the breadcrumbs instead!
							</p>
							<p>
								From this screen you can either start a <a href="matches">single match</a> or a <a href="#contests">contest.</a> To do this, simply click the big blue button which corresponds to your choice of game type.
							</p>

							<h2>Rules</h2>
							<p>
								AntGame is fairly simple. Here are the rules:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The team who gathers the most food wins.</li>
								<li>Food is counted as being "gathered" if it has been dropped on one of the team's home cells. Food that an ant is carrying is not counted, even if that ant is standing on a home cell.</li>
								<li>When an ant is adjacent to 5 or more enemy ants it dies, depositing 3 food particles in the cell it was in.</li>
								<li>At the start of the game, each home cell for a particular color ant is populated with an ant of that color facing east.</li>
								<li>Ants cannot move onto rocky cells.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>There are also some <a href="#worldrules">rules concerning the formation of worlds</a>.</p>
							<div class="pull-right"><a href="#top"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i> top</a></div>
						</div>

						<a name="matches"></a>
						<div class="docsection" style="clear: left">
							<hr>
							<h2>Single Match</h2>
							<p>
								The Single Match mode lets you select two <a href="#brains">brains</a>, and play them against each other on one <a href="#worlds">world</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Single Match setup screen looks like this:
							</p>
							<center><img src="./img/sm-setup.png"></center>
							<p>
								To choose which <a href="#brains">brains</a> and which <a href="#worlds">world</a> to use, simply click the corresponding blue "pick" button.
							</p>
							<p>
								You may have noticed that the brains are colored red and black. This means that they will start in different places in the world, so if your brain doesn't perform particularly well, fear not! Try swapping the colors around and you may fare better. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Before you run the game, you can change some settings. Notice a text field with some numbers? That's the number of rounds or <em>iterations</em> that the game will last for. Be careful not to pick a number which is too low, or your ants might not have enough time to gather food! The maximum number of rounds is 999,999.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another setting which you can change is whether or not the game runs with graphics. If you're strapped for time, running the game without graphics is much faster. Click the orange button to toggle graphics on and off.
							</p>
							<p>
								To <a href="#running">run the game</a>, click the green "go" button. When the game is finished, you will be presented with a window showing the results of the match. It should look a bit like this:
							</p>
							<center><img src="./img/sm-results.png"></center>
							<p>
								As you can see, it shows how much food was gathered by each team and how many ants died on each team too.

							<h2>Worlds</h2>
							<p>In AntGame, worlds are 2D hexagonal grids. You can make your own, or generate random ones on-the-fly.</p> 
							<p>Worlds consist of four types of cells:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Rock</li>
								<li>Clear</li>
								<li>Red Home</li>
								<li>Black Home</li>
							</ul>

							<a name="worldsuse"></a>
							<h3>How To Use Them</h3>
							<p>When asked to choose a world or some worlds, you are presented with the following screen:</p>
							<center><img src="./img/worldlist.png"></center>
							<p>On the left you see a list of available worlds. On the right is shown the thumbnail for the currently selected world.</p>
							<p>To choose a world, simply click the green "use" button that appears when you hover over it in the list.</p>
							<p>To generate random contest-legal worlds, click the green "generate" button.</p>

							<a name="worldsadd"></a>
							<h3>How To Add a New One</h3>
							<p>Worlds can be added by clicking the blue "add" button shown in the screenshot above. A window will open that allows you to give your new world a name, specify it's source code, and then compile it for use in AntGame. The window will look like this:</p>
							<center><img src="./img/worldedit.png"></center>
							<p>If your world fails to compile, you will recieve an alert stating the error in your code. You can then fix the error and try to compile again. If you change your mind about adding a new world, click cancel at any time to return to the list of available worlds.</p>

							<p>
								If you've added a new world, when you hover over it in the list of available worlds, you will now have the option to delete it (the red button), or edit it (the yellow button). 
							</p>
							<center><img src="./img/worldcustom.png"></center>
							<p>
								If you choose to edit a world, it works just like adding a new one except that when you recompile, it will overwrite the one you chose to edit.

							<a name="brainswrite"></a>
							<h3>How To Write Them</h3>
							<p>In AntGame, an ant is a simple state machine. That is to say, ants can only be in one state at any given time. Each state specifies some instruction which tells an ant what to do next.</p>
							<p>Brains are, in that respect, an ordered series of states. States are numbered from 0 to n-1 where n is the total number of states in the brain.</p>
							<p>Instructions for each state are written in a text file. Every line that contains an instruction represents a single state. You can't specify the number of a particular state. Rather, they are numbered implicity by the order in which they appear in the file.</p>
							<p>To begin, let's take a look at the full set of instructions our ants understand: (don't worry if <em>you</em> don't yet!)</p>
							<a name="brainsinstr"></a>
							<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
								<thead>

							<p>Let me just explain those a bit more carefully...</p>

									<a name="brainssense"></a>
									<h3 class="antcode bleu">Sense</h3>
									<p>Above we see the example as follows:</p>
									<pre class="well antcode thinner"><span class="bleu">Sense</span> sensedir st1 st2 cond</pre>
									<p>There are a variety of different ways this can be used, for example:</p>
									<pre class="well antcode thinner"><span class="bleu">Sense</span> Ahead 1 3 Food</pre>
									<p>Would search to see if there is food directly in front of the ant, going to State 1 if there is, and going to State 3 if there isn't.</p>
									
									<p>The options for <span class="antcode">sensedir</span> are: </p>
									<div class="pull-left"><img  src="./img/sensedirs.png" /></div>
									<div class="pull-left">
										<ul>
											<li><span class="antcode" style="background: #8cc63f; color: black; padding: 1px 3px;">Here</span> (the cell the ant is currently occupying)</li>
											<li><span class="antcode" style="background: #7ed3ed; color: black; padding: 1px 3px;">Ahead</span> (the cell directly ahead of the ant)</li>

										</ul>
									</div>
									<div style="clear: both;"></div><br>
									<p>An ant cannot sense behind the direction it is facing.</p>
									<p>The options for <span class="antcode">cond</span> are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><span class="antcode" style="color: black;">Friend</span>  (a friendly ant)</li>
										<li><span class="antcode" style="color: black;">Foe</span>  (an enemy ant)</li>

										<li><span class="antcode" style="color: black;">Marker i</span>  (where i is the type of marker)</li>
										<li><span class="antcode" style="color: black;">FoeMarker</span> (Ants can only check if an enemy marker is present, they cannot detect white type of marker it is)</li>
										<li><span class="antcode" style="color: black;">Home</span> (Friendly ant nest)</li>
										<li><span class="antcode" style="color: black;">FoeHome</span> (Enemy ant nest)</li>
									</ul>
									
								</li>

								<li>
									<a name="brainsmark"></a>
									<h3 class="antcode bleu">Mark</h3>
									<p>Above we see:</p>
									<pre class="well antcode thinner"><span class="bleu">Mark</span> i st</pre>
									<p>An example use of this instruction would be:</p>
									<pre class="well antcode thinner"><span class="bleu">Mark</span> 0 3</pre>
									<p>This would put a marker of type 0 (Markers can be of type 0-5) in the cell the ant is currently in, then move to state 3, markers are key to creating an advanced brain.</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<a name="brainsunmark"></a>
									<h3 class="antcode bleu">Unmark</h3>
									<p>This instruction is the opposite of the mark function. It removes the specified marker from the cell the ant is currently in. An example:</p>
									<pre class="well antcode thinner"><span class="bleu">Unmark</span> 3 0</pre>
									<p>This would remove the marker of type 3 from the cell the ant is currently in, then move to state 0.</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<a name="brainspickup"></a>
									<h3 class="antcode bleu">Pickup</h3>
									<p>Above we see:</p>
									<pre class="well antcode thinner"><span class="bleu">Pickup</span> st1 st2</pre>		
									<p>This will cause the ant to attempt to pickup food from the cell it is currently in. If the ant is successful, it will go to the state specified by <span class="antcode">st1</span>. If there is no food in the current cell, then it will go to the state specified by <span class="antcode">st2</span></p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<a name="brainsdrop"></a>
									<h3 class="antcode bleu">Drop</h3>
									<p>Above we see:</p>
									<pre class="well antcode thinner"><span class="bleu">Drop</span> st</pre>	
									<p>This instruction causes an ant to drop food if it is carrying any. Regardless of whether any food was dropped, the ant will then go to the state specified by <span class="antcode">st</span>.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a name="brainsturn"></a>
									<h3 class="antcode bleu">Turn</h3>
									<p>Above we see:</p>
									<pre class="well antcode thinner"><span class="bleu">Turn</span> lr st</pre>	
									<p>This instruction causes an ant to turn one step (60 degrees) in the direction specified by <span class="antcode">lr</span>, and then go to the state specified by <span class="antcode">st</span>.</p>
									<p>The two possible values of <span class="antcode">lr</span> are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><span class="antcode" style="color: black">Left</span></li>
										<li><span class="antcode" style="color: black">Right</span></li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a name="brainsmove"></a>
									<h3 class="antcode bleu">Move</h3>
									<p>Above we see:</p>
									<pre class="well antcode thinner"><span class="bleu">Move</span> st1 st2</pre>	
									<p>This instruction causes an ant to attempt to move one step in the direction it is facing. If the ant is successful, it will go to the state specified by <span class="antcode">st1</span>. If the cell ahead is blocked for some reason, then it will go to the state specified by <span class="antcode">st2</span></p>. Be weary of using this instruction because, if an ant is successful in moving, they cannot do anything for the next 14 iterations the game!
								</li>
								<li>
									<a name="brainsflip"></a>
									<h3 class="antcode bleu">Flip</h3>
									<p>This instruction provides the ability to inject a degree of uncertainty into the actions of your ants.</p>
									<p>Above we see:</p>
									<pre class="well antcode thinner"><span class="bleu">Flip</span> p st1 st2</pre>	
									<p><span class="antcode">p</span> is an integer with any value &ge; 0. This number gives a <em>probability</em> that the ant will end up in <span class="antcode">st1</span>. The value of this probability is 1/<span class="antcode">p</span>. (so if <span class="antcode">p</span> has value 0 or 1, the ant will always go to <span class="antcode">st1</span>). Otherwise, the ant will go to <span class="antcode">st2</span>.</p>
									<p>To illustrate:</p>
									<pre class="well antcode thinner"><span class="bleu">Flip</span> 3 1 7</pre>
									This gives the ant a 1 in 3 chance of going to state 1 and, therefore, a 2 in 3 chance of going to state 7.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<a name="brainsnotes"></a>
							<h3>Notes</h3>
							<p>Brain code is case-insensitive.</p>
							<p>The code can also be commented using a semicolon to delimit the start of a comment. Anything which follows a semicolon until the end of the line is ignored by the compiler. To illustrate this, have a look at the example code below.</p>

							<a name="brainsexample"></a>
							<h3>An Example Brain</h3>
							<p>To conclude, we will look at a complete (but simple) brain. This brain has been commented to help you understand what is going on. If you want to look at a completed brain in correct syntax, please look at one of the sample brains provided in the game, you can look at these by selecting "Single Match" "Pick" Then highlighting the brain you want to view the source code for.</p>

<span class="bleu">Move</span> 8 11 <span style="color: black">; state 15: ...or move forward and return to state 8</span></pre>
							<p>More complicated brains would have functions for finding enemy ants and killing them, protecting the colony, potentially even raiding the enemy colony.</p>
